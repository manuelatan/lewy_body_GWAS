# lewy_body_GWAS
Cortical Lewy Body (LB) GWAS run for Lesley Wu and Huw Morris on the Netherlands Brain Bank (NBB) NeuroChip data and Mayo clinic data

This is a case-control GWAS where we defined cases as individuals with Braak stage 5-6, and controls as individuals with Braak stage 1-4. We included all autopsy cases with a diagnosis of Lewy bodies with clinical data on sex and age at death
